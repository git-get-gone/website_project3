Hi, My name is Jordan Vickers. I am a soon to be graduate of St. Olaf College as a Physics and Math major with a concentration in Statistics and Data Science. I love any kind of problems that involve pattern recognition and enjoy keeping both my mind and body active! I hope to continuously update this site with new and exciting projects showcasing my aptitude and passion for working with data. On this website, I would like to highlight some of my projects I have contributed on throughout my time at St. Olaf.
